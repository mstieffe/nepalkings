# Nepal Kings

**Nepal Kings** is a two-player online card game. Some call it *the chess of cards*.  
It is a strategic duel built around the principle of **attack and defense**, played in two main phases:

1. **Build Phase** – players prepare their field, set up figures, and ready their battle cards.  
2. **Battle Phase** – the actual fight takes place, points are awarded, and attacker/defender roles may switch.  

The first player to reach the pre-set score (21, 35, or 49 points) wins the game.

## Game Start

- At the beginning, roles are assigned: one **attacker**, one **defender**.  
- This is determined by cutting the deck:  
  - The revealed **symbol** defines the **Ur-King**.  
  - The revealed **color** defines the **role** (black = defender, red = attacker).  
- Each player receives **12 hand cards** (hand limit).  
  - In the first round hands are always refilled to 12 cards.  
  - In later rounds only up to 5.  

---

## Build Phase

- The phase consists of **5 regular turns**, followed by:  
  - an **advance move** from the attacker  
  - a **reaction move** from the defender  
- On a turn, a player may:  
  - exchange cards  
  - play an action card  
  - place, pick up, or modify a figure on the field  

### Sub-Phases
- **Passive Build Phase** – only passive action cards allowed, no advancing.  
- **Active Build Phase** – all action cards allowed, advancing possible.

## Battle Phase

1. Both players secretly select their fighting figures and 3 battle cards.  
2. Figures are revealed, combat strength is calculated (including bonuses).  
3. Players take **3 battle turns** each to play their battle cards.  
4. The winner scores points based on the defeated figure, modified by special rules.  

### Special Battles
- **Direct Battle** – no advancing required, free choice of figures (triggered by Jacks, Queens, or Aces).  
- **Peasants’ War** – only operators may fight.  
- **King’s Battle** – forced duel with the King, featuring unique high-stakes rules.  
- **Blitzkrieg** – triggered by two Queens; attacker chooses the target.  

---

## Bonus System

- Fighting figures can receive bonus support from other field cards:  
  - Only once per donor figure.  
  - Only with matching symbols.  
- Symbol clashes follow a rock-paper-scissors pattern:  
  - hearts beats clubs
  - clubs beats diamonds
  - diamonds beats spades
  - spades beats hearts

- The losing symbol costs **–1 point**.

## Game Modes

- **Limited** – only one active action card per phase (counterplay allowed).  
- **Free for all** – unlimited active action cards in sequence, all effects stack.
